# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Weather App to GitHub Pages for free!

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Your weather app files ready

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

Make sure you have these files in your project folder:
- `index.html` (main application file)
- `README.md` (project documentation)
- `.gitignore` (git ignore rules)
- Any images or assets

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

Open your terminal/command prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Weather App"
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `Weather` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "A beautiful weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
   - **Visibility**: Choose "Public" (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (since you already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 4: Connect and Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Weather.git

# Rename the main branch (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to the "Pages" section (in the left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch from the dropdown
6. Select "/ (root)" folder
7. Click "Save"

### Step 6: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site
- This usually takes 2-5 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

### Step 7: Access Your Live Website

Your website will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Weather/
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 🔧 Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. In the Pages settings, enter your domain name
2. Add a `CNAME` file to your repository with your domain
3. Configure your domain's DNS settings

## 📝 Updating Your Website

To update your website after making changes:

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Update weather app"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy your updated site.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Page not found (404)**
   - Make sure your main file is named `index.html`
   - Check that the repository is public

2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Look for the latest deployment status

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your weather app will be:
- ✅ Live on the internet
